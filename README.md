# DialogFlowES-BOT
In this we have create a REST API that can receive a webhook request from the bot weâ€™ve built and dropped it here in zipped file and the API is built on C# language doing some tasks. As now we have created this API but it is not counting such functions as defined above means we are unable to make it interact with the bot.
